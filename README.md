# MolScore: An automated scoring function to facilitate and standardize evaluation of goal-directed generative models for de novo molecular design

## Overview

The aim of this codebase is to simply and flexibly 
automate the scoring of *de novo* compounds in generative models (`molscore`).
In doing so, also track and record de novo compounds for automated evaluation downstream (`moleval`).

1. Install both python packages
2. Implement molscore in a generative model script (substituted for a scoring function)
3. Describe the desired objective with a configuration file that is passed to `molscore`
4. Run generative model optimization
5. Evaluate *de novo* molecules with `moleval`

The objective can be reproduced and shared via the configuration file to create new benchmarks, or to conduct multi-parameter objectives for AI discovery.

It is also easy to add new custom scoring function - see [here](https://github.com/MorganCThomas/MolScore/blob/main/molscore/scoring_functions/README.MD)

In total only **3 lines of code are needed** to implement into generative models (...althought 5 is preferable, sorry).

Contributions and/or ideas for added functionality are welcomed!

## Installation

To install molscore:

```
git clone https://github.com/MorganCThomas/MolScore.git
cd MolScore
conda env create -f molscore_environment.yml
conda activate molscore
python setup_molscore.py develop
```

To install moleval:
```
conda env create -f moleval_environment.yml
conda activate moleval
python setup_moleval.py develop
```

## Implementation

Implementing `molscore` is as simple as importing it, instantiating it (pointing to the configuration file) and then scoring molecules. This should easily fit into most generative model pipelines.

```python
from molscore.manager import MolScore

# Instantiate MolScore and point to configuration file
ms = MolScore(model_name='test',
              task_config='molscore/configs/QED.json')
              
# Calling it simply scores a list of smiles (SMILES)
scores = ms(SMILES)
    
# When finished, all recorded smiles need to be saved and the live monitor killed
ms.write_scores()
ms.kill_monitor()
```

## Usage

First we need to decide the objective by writing a configuration json file. What a pain!

Instead let's use an app to write it for us! This app contains parameters, their descriptions and defaults.

```
streamlit run molscore/config_generator.py
```

Then simply point use this configuration file and run *de novo* molecule optimization. If running with the live monitor you'll be able to investigate molecules as they're being generated.
