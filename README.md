# MolScore: A scoring, evaluation and benchmarking framework for de novo drug design
![alt text](https://github.com/MorganCThomas/MolScore/blob/v1.0/molscore/data/images/GraphAbv2.png?raw=True)
## Overview

MolScore contains code to score *de novo* compounds in the context of generative *de novo* design by generative models via the subpackage `molscore`, as well as, facilitate downstream evaluation via the subpackage `moleval`. An objective is defined via a JSON file which can be shared to propose new multi-parameter objectives for drug design. MolScore can be used in several ways:
1. To implement a multi-parameter objective to for prospective drug design.
2. To benchmark objectives/generative models/optimization using benchmark mode (MolScoreBenchmark).
3. To implement a sequence of objectives using curriculum mode (MolScoreCurriculum).

Generative models with MolScore already integrated can be found [here](https://github.com/MorganCThomas/MolScore_examples). 

Contributions and/or ideas for added functionality are welcomed!


## Installation
MolScore can be installed by cloning this repository and setting up an environment using your favourite environment manager (I recommend [mamba](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge)).

    git clone https://github.com/MorganCThomas/MolScore.git
    cd MolScore
    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    mamba activate molscore
    pip install ./

**Note:** You can use `pip install -e ./` to install in develop mode.

Alternatively, MolScore is available via the Python Package Index.

    pip install molscore --upgrade

**Installation time**: Installation of molscore in the environment should complete in less than 5 minutes (tested using mamba).

## Functionality
Scoring functionality present in **molscore**, some scoring functions require external softwares and necessary licenses.

## Usage
For further details, we refer you to the [tutorials](tutorials). Here is a snapshot of using MolScore with the GUIs available.

Here is a GIF demonstrating writing a config file with the help of the GUI, running MolScore in a mock example (scoring randomly sampled SMILES), and monitoring the output with another GUI.

Once `molscore` has been implemented into a generative model, the objective needs to be defined! Writing a JSON file is a pain though so instead a streamlit app is provided do help. Simply call `molscore_config` from the command line (a simple wrapper to `streamlit run molscore/gui/config.py`)

Once the configuration file is saved, simply point to this file path and run *de novo* molecule optimization. If running with the monitor app you'll be able to investigate molecules as they're being generated. Simply call `molscore_monitor` from the command line (a wrapper to `streamlit run molscore/gui/monitor.py`).
