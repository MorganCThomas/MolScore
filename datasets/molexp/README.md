This dataset is curated from the ChEMBL34 database (Gaulton et al., 2012). First, the database was filtered to ensure no molecules existed with more 10 rotatable bonds, a logP above 5.5, a molecular weight outside of 150-650 Da, or contained atoms not in a comment set $a \in {C, N, S, O, F, Cl, Br, H}$. All molecules were neutralized if possible, converted to non-isomeric SMILES (i.e., containing no stereoinformation) and de-duplicated. This resulted in a dataset of 1,711,022 unique molecules.
